- to study, for online calibration of IMU mounting angle, w.r.t vehicle
```
# Introduction 
This MATLAB code package implements a Kalman filter to estimate the mounting angles of a IMU with respect to the host vehicle, as described in the manuscript “Estimation of IMU Mounting Angles for Land Vehicular GNSS/INS Integrated System” by Qijin Chen et al. It is aimed at helping the readers to understand the manuscript and implement the algorithm. This self-contained package includes all required files and data. 
# How to use this package 
1）	Copy this package including all subdirectories and files to your computer. 

2）	Set the directory as the current path of the MATLAB.

3）	Run ‘main.m’ to start the data processing. 

Then try to change the data files (cfg.fins) or the segment of trajectory used for mounting angle estimation.
